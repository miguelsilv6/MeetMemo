"""
Hardware profile resolution for MeetMemo.

Maps a named hardware profile (or ``auto`` with GPU-VRAM detection) to sensible
defaults for the ML pipeline: Whisper model size, compute precision, diarization
model, and device.

This module is intentionally free of heavy imports (``torch``) at load time so
the profile-selection logic can be unit-tested in isolation. VRAM/GPU detection
imports ``torch`` lazily inside the detection helpers.
